# txt_adjuster

## Definition of Tasks
The project tasks are focused on developing graphical user interfaces (GUI) for auto-adjusting text to mouse selected area inside of an image using PyQt5. 

GUI is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

The text itself should be able to modified with different fonts and sizes, and it should be equipped with wrapping function based on the content.

The space occupied by the input text should be evaluated and compared with the area the user set with mouse. If the text is overflowed out of the bounding box selected, the user should be able
to choose to ignore it or clear the content.
